# **ACT I — The Kingdom of Crispian**

*Enter KING NUGGETUS, PRINCE DIPPINGTON, and SIR SAUCELOT.*

**KING NUGGETUS:**
Hark, noble kin, dost thou perceive the scent?
That golden perfume rising from yon fryer?
It sings of triumph, hunger’s pure delight,
A crispy ball of joy made fit for kings.

**PRINCE DIPPINGTON:**
Aye, father, every breeze that blows o’er Crispian
smelleth of triumph seasoned ’gainst despair.
No mortal feast may rival thy creation—
not beast nor bread nor burger overdone.

**SIR SAUCELOT:**
My liege, a foreign monarch journeys hence—
One Kim, called Jong-un, eater of no renown.
He bringeth not the crunch nor blessed breading,
but holds himself in flavor’s haughty pride.

**KING NUGGETUS:**
Then let him come.
For in our court, the tongue is sovereign judge.
And flavor’s truth shall cast his boast aside.

*Thunder of sizzling oil. Enter THE FRYER ORACLE.*

**THE FRYER ORACLE:**
Beware, O Nuggetus!
A rival comes without a seasoning soul.
But in his blandness shall thy glory rise.
For all the world shall know and loudly hail:
*No human king shall best the nugget’s taste.*

*Exit Oracle.*

**KING NUGGETUS:**
Let destiny be served.
Prepare the banquet!

*Exeunt.*

# **ACT II — The Arrival of the Flavorless Monarch**

*Enter KIM JONG-UN with attendants, awkwardly.*

**KIM JONG-UN:**
Greetings, crisp pretenders to my throne.
I come unseasoned, yet supreme in power.
What need have I of crunch or humble spice?
For I rule men, and not the dinner plate.

**CHORUS (aside):**
O folly! O hubris most unbattered!
He knoweth not the might of nugget kind.
For who can stand ’gainst golden crust divine?

**KING NUGGETUS:**
Welcome, Kim of Un, though flavorless thy claim.
Sit with us at table. Let tongues declare
where lies true sovereignty.

**KIM JONG-UN:**
I accept—
though ’tis beneath me to duel with food.

*Enter LADY TEMPURA with a silver platter of shining nuggets.*

**LADY TEMPURA:**
Behold the feast!
These nuggets, forged in fryer’s sacred flame,
do hum with joy and destiny fulfilled.

**KIM JONG-UN:**
Pah!
How mighty can a morsel truly be?

*He takes a reluctant bite. Instantly, heavenly light.*

**KIM JONG-UN (choking on emotion):**
What sorcery is this!?
Such flavor! Such delight! Such perfect form!
I—I cannot compete with such a taste.
My reign is done. My palate overthrown.

# **ACT III — The Court of Sauces**

**SIR SAUCELOT:**
Bring forth the Seven Bowls!
Ranch, Honey Mustard, Barbecue,
Sweet & Sour, Buffalo, Garlic Aioli,
and the Sacred Orange Sauce unnamed by man.

*Seven bowls shimmer like jewels.*

**PRINCE DIPPINGTON:**
Choose one, O visiting monarch.
But fear: each sauce reveals the eater’s truth.

**KIM JONG-UN:**
I choose… the orange one.
Its glow compels me.

*He dips a nugget. Choir sings.*

**KIM JONG-UN:**
Oh heavens!
My soul is battered—my pride, deep-fried!
No mortal man can triumph over thee,
O Nugget! Crunch-born glory of the gods!

---

# **ACT IV — Prophecy Fulfilled**

*Enter THE FRYER ORACLE again.*

**THE FRYER ORACLE:**
Behold!
The flavorless king is conquered not by war,
but by the golden alchemy of taste.
Thus ends the boast of blandness.
Thus begins the era of eternal crisp.

**KING NUGGETUS:**
Let it be written!
From this day forth, the world shall know
that chicken nuggets reign above all kings.

**PRINCE DIPPINGTON:**
Let fryers roar and sauces overflow!
For victory is dipped and served tonight!

---

# **ACT V — The Coronation of Eternal Crisp**

*The people gather. Music swells.*

**CHORUS:**
O crispy joy!
O golden round of heaven’s art!
Behold the triumph of the nugget fair
o’er mortal flesh and flavorless despair.

**KIM JONG-UN (kneeling):**
I yield, O Nugget Kingdom.
Teach me the way of crunch.
Let me live not as a king,
but as a humble eater at thy fryer’s gate.

**KING NUGGETUS:**
Rise, Kim of Un.
Thou art redeemed by breading’s holy grace.
Go forth and speak the gospel of the Crunch.

*All raise their nuggets.*

**ALL:**
Long live the Nugget!
Long reign the Crunch!
May sauce forever bless our tongues!

*Curtain falls as the fryer sizzles.*
